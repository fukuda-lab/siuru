# Reporting 

These components are used in the demo configurations to store model predictions. It is possible to run the demos without InfluxDB + Grafana reporting by removing the ``InfluxDBReporter`` entry from the output section of configuration files.

## Quickstart

To store model predictions, we will need the components of InfluxDB + Grafana, which can be found in the ``docker-compose`` file located in this folder.

To simplify the configuration of the connection between InfluxDB and Grafana, the script ``initial_reporting.sh`` has been created. This script is also responsible for installing and starting the containers.

The script is executed as follows:

```bash
./split_dataset.sh
```

Once the script is executed, InfluxDB and Grafana containers will be up and running. In the event that these containers are deleted, the script will need to be executed again.

### .env

To send SIURU model predictions to our InfluxDB database, we will need an ``INFLUXDB_TOKEN`` generated by the previous script, which can be found in the .env file.

### Dashboards

In case you want to load a Grafana dashboard directly into the container, we have the ``dashboards`` folder into ``grafana-provisioning`` where you can load it. 

For the example case ``window-multi-rf-influxdb-test.json.jinja2`` we have loaded the dashboard ``window-multi-rf``.
